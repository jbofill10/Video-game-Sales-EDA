Having played on all playstation consoles up to date, I found it interesting that PS2 had the most sales of all the other consoles in the PlayStation and Xbox brand.

Interesting that there was a large spike in 2010-2012 and then it just falls off. I would've expected it to increase more due to many games being on the "online store" and people don't have to go out to the local GameStop to buy a game. 

## Genres with Most Revenue Globally

Interesting to see that Action games are the most successful.

What's interesting here is that Action is never any countries favorite genre, except for the spike in EU from 1990-1995 -- yet it has the most global sales out of all the genres.
